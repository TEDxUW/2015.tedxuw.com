                        <dt><a href="#">Could I get a quick breakdown of the event details for TEDxUW 2015?</a></dt>
                        <dd>Sure! TEDxUW will take place on November 14th 2015 at the Centre of International Governance and Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. TEDx conferences typically have a theme in place and our theme for this year’s conference is “The Power of Collaboration”, in its realest and broadest form. Our phenomenal speakers will be exploring collaboration within an eclectic range of frameworks (from political and corporate collaboration to collaboration in our daily lives and relationships) and the day is going to be completely reflective of the theme. The schedule for the day will be published on our website shortly!</dd>
                        
                        <dt><a href="#">How can I attend TEDxUW?</a></dt>
                        <dd>We care about our audience just as much as we care about our speakers; they are two crucial components of our event. In order to attend the event, you will need to take part in an application process. Due to rules in place for independently organized TEDx events, we can only select 100 lucky delegates so you can say that the process is fairly competitive.<br><br> So, what are we looking for in our delegates? People who are passionate about all things TED and ideas worth spreading, individuals who are enthusiastic, driven, eager to learn and meet individuals from various walks of life. The application process consists of one simple application form with a couple of questions that you will need to answer, try to be yourself and be honest in your application. Each application will be reviewed carefully and scored independently by our Attendee Relations team. More information on the application process timeline and the form itself will be found on our website and social media channels closer to the time.</dd>

                        <dd>We love having new people join our TEDxUW family of change-makers and we have plenty of opportunities for you to get involved. You can be a part of the movement in many ways: through applying to be a speaker/nominating a potential speaker, applying to join our core team, being one of our powerhouse volunteers (our greatest pride!), covering our event as media, partnering with us, being a sponsor, the list is endless.

                        <dd>At TEDxUW, we really care about the speakers you have in mind! With that said, every year, we have a Speaker Nomination Process in place whereby you can nominate either yourself, somebody you know or somebody you think would make a great TEDx speaker.

                        <dd>We’re sorry about that; the application process is very competitive but this doesn’t mean we don’t care about you or appreciate your enthusiasm in TEDx! Ideally, we would love to open our doors to each and every one of you. With that said, this does not in any way mean we don’t care about you! We’re holding a live stream event on Nov 14th from 1 - 7:30 pm at the Student Life Centre, Great Hall, on UWaterloo’s main campus. Bring your family, friends and colleagues and enjoy 12 incredible TEDx talks.

We look forward to interacting with you. </dd>
